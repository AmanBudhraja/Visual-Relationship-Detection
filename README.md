# Visual-Relationship Detection -VRD
The visual relationship detection is identifying the relations between objects in an image. The machine
learning algorithms used, require a large database as the models were trained for almost every type of
relationship, which this project tries to tackle. This project has two unique factors, 1) A model was
trained to extract the features of the objects and their rel ationship. 2)These extracted features were,
with a word embedding algorithm, used to train a model to detect the relationships. Hence, by creating
a language bias, the dataset required for training will be relatively small and be useful in cases where
the occurrence of a relationship is infrequent.
